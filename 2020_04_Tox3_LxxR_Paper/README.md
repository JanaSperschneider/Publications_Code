A python script to search for the occurrence of Kex2-processed pro-domains (K2PP) in secreted fungal effectors and in fungal secretomes.

First, SignalP 3.0 is run to determine the signal peptide cleavage site based on the Y-score. We then search for occurrences of LxxR, KR or RR motifs in the mature secreted protein. 

For all motif positions, we analyse the N-terminal sequence before the motif and the C-terminal sequence after the motif. If the N-terminal sequence is longer than four amino acids and the C-terminal sequence occupies more than half of the mature secreted protein, it is analysed further. We analyse the percentages of amino acids that are associated with disorder (K, E, N, S, P, G, R, D, Q, M) (Weathers et al., 2004) in the N-terminal sequence and in the C-terminal sequence. If at least two-thirds of amino acids in the N-terminal sequence are disorder-promoting and if the proportion of  disorder-promoting amino acids in the N-terminal sequences is higher than in the C-terminal sequence, the secreted protein is labelled as having a predicted disordered region with a Kex2 protease cleavage site. Fungal effectors are taken from the EffectorP 2.0 publication (Sperschneider et al., 2018).
