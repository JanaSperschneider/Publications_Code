A python script to search for the occurrence of Kex2-processed pro-domains (K2PP) in secreted fungal effectors and in fungal secretomes.

First, SignalP 3.0 is run to determine the signal peptide cleavage site based on the Y-score. We then search for occurrences of LxxR, KR or RR motifs in the mature secreted protein. 

For all motif positions, we analysed the N-terminal sequence before the motif (excluding the predicted signal peptide) and the C terminal sequence after the motif. If the N terminal sequence was longer than four amino acids and the C terminal sequence occupied more than half of the mature secreted protein, it was analysed further. We analysed the percentages of amino acids that are associated with disorder (K, E, N, S, P, G, R, D, Q, M) and those that are associated with order (W, Y, F, I, C, L, V, H) (Weathers et al., 2004) in the N-terminal sequence and in the C-terminal sequence. If at least two-thirds of amino acids in the N-terminal sequence are disorder-promoting (disorder-promoting aas/(disorder-promoting aas + order-promoting aas)) and if the proportion of disorder-promoting amino acids in the N terminal sequences is higher than in the C-terminal sequence, the secreted protein was labelled as having a predicted disordered region with a Kex2 protease cleavage site. Fungal effectors were taken from the EffectorP 2.0 publication (Sperschneider et al., 2018).
